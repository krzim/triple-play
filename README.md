## 1.0 Update Overview

WALKOFF 1.0 is intended to present a more robust and scalable implementation of Apps and Workers. 
Due to the scale of the changes, this should be considered an alpha version of WALKOFF 1.0, and is for testing and 
evaluation only. **There is much work to be done, and it is not stable, feature-complete or production-ready.**

In the coming weeks, we will be continually releasing bugfixes, documentation, and tests to bring this to a stable 
state and begin adding non-core functionality. See [our roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for more details. You can also follow [the changelog](CHANGELOG.md) to keep up with the latest changes.

If you do test this out, please submit issues here when you encounter any bugs or have any suggestions so we can 
continue to improve the WALKOFF platform. 

For app development instructions, see [the app SDK](app_sdk/README.md).

If you would like to view version 0.9.4, see [the master branch](https://github.com/nsacyber/WALKOFF/tree/master).
